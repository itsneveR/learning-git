git

/**************************************LOCAL*****************************/

*most of the version controling happens on local machine

*git maintains 3 local storages on local machine(in other words git maintains our code in 3 different stages)
	
	** (1) Working Directory -where we modify our files- (Modified State)
	** (2) Staging Directory -where we keep our files before committing- (Staged State)(Staging Area)
	** (3) Local Repository  -where we keep the final committed version of the code- (Committed State) /git database is here/ all the branches and content tree are in this part




> git init // Create an empty Git repository -git repository gets created-

> git add .<file path> // moves files from "working directory" to "Staging Directory"

> git commit //moves files from "Staging Directory" to "Local Repository"  


/************************************REMOTE*****************************/

> git push //moves files from "Local Repository" to a "Remote Repository like github ..."





/**********************************BRANCHING***************************/


*never work directly on master branch, if want to make changes, you'd better create a branch out of your master branch, work on it and test it, then merge it with master branch.

 
> git branch <new branch's name>

> git checkout <branch's name> 
> git switch <branch's name>

>git merge <branch's name> /*check out the branch you wish to merge into and then run the "git merge" command:*/
